# Frontend-developer-Intern-Techwox-Solutions-
I successfully completed my six-monthsinternship as a Front-end web developer at Techwox Solutions from 07/04/2025 to 07/10/2025.

During my internship, I primarily worked on front-end web development using React.js, focusing on designing and building interactive and user-friendly web pages. I was responsible for creating responsive layouts, implementing animations, carousels, and light/dark mode features to enhance the overall user experience. In addition, I used Git and GitHub for version control, which helped me manage code efficiently and collaborate smoothly with team members. I also participated in project planning and task tracking using Jira, ensuring that all projects, including the Company Website and Chatme (Real-Time Chat Application), were completed on time and met quality standards.

# Objectives 

• Improve front-end expertise by crafting responsive and interactive web applications with React.js through Vite and Tailwind CSS styling. 
• Add UI functionalities such as toggle color mode (light/dark mode), animations, and interactive carousels to enhance usability. 
• Practice current web development best practices by incorporating performance optimizations, enabling mobile responsiveness, and following industry coding standards. 
• Get practical experience with version control using Git and GitHub for team-based code management, branch maintenance, and tracking project history. 
• Use Jira for project management to plan, assign, and track tasks with proper communication among the team.
